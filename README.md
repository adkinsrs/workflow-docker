# workflow-docker
Dockerfile and contents for the Workflow pipeline creation and monitoring system

## Description
The Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) has many process-using pipelines that need to be created, executed, and monitored on an on-going basis. Each pipeline may include multiple discrete processes that can be executed either sequentially or in parallel. To reduce manual intervention, and streamline the process flow, IGS's Annotation software team has designed a system called Workflow that can be used to build, run, and monitor such process pipelines or workflows.
